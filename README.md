# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis will show the relationship between the type of city, drivers, and riders. It will also show the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This will help make decisions on improving access to ride sharing services and determine affordability in under served neighborhoods.

## Results

### City Type Summary

#### Urban Cities
For riders the best city type to get a ride is Urban. There are the most drivers available and the average fare per ride is the lowest. 

For drivers this may not be the case. Though the number of rides was the highest, the number of drivers exceeded the number of rides. This means many drivers (780) did not provide rides to customers at all. This would also effect the Average Fare per driver. Drivers that did provide rides to customers likely earned more than the average displayed, but 780 drivers didn't earn any money.

#### Non-Urban Cites
The Rural and Suburban city types had rides that exceded the number of drivers. This means that some drivers provided multiple rides to customers. Though there is less competition among drivers there are less riders looking for rides in rural and suburban areas. This is probably why rides and driver earnings in these areas are higher per ride.
