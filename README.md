# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis will show the relationship between the type of city, drivers, and riders. It will also show the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This will help make decisions on improving access to ride sharing services and determine affordability in under served neighborhoods.

## Results

### City Type Summary

#### Urban Cities
For riders the best city type to get a ride is Urban. There are the most drivers available and the average fare per ride is the lowest. 

For drivers this may not be the case. Though the number of rides was the highest, the number of drivers exceeded the number of rides. This means many drivers (780) did not provide rides to customers at all. This would also effect the Average Fare per driver. Drivers that did provide rides to customers likely earned more than the average displayed, but 780 drivers didn't earn any money.

#### Non-Urban Cites
The Rural and Suburban city types had rides that exceded the number of drivers. This means that some drivers provided multiple rides to customers. Though there is less competition among drivers there are less riders looking for rides in rural and suburban areas. This is probably why rides and driver earnings in these areas are higher per ride.


### Total Fares by City Type

The graph shows that most of the fares earned were in Urban areas. 

There seems to be more peaks in the data for the Urban city type, where fares were higher for a specific point in time. Its possible that the most successful urban drivers were driving during this time, and drivers that didn't provide any rides were not driving during these times.

## Summary
One suggestion would be to make a program that encourages urban drivers to drive in rural and suburban areas. This would drive down the cost of rides for customers in non-urban areas and there are probably drivers that are willing to go to these areas because they didn't earn any money in urban areas.

Another suggestion would be to provide drivers with information regarding peak times when customers are seeking rides. This might be helpful to some of the urban drivers that didn't provide any rides to customers.
